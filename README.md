# Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

## Introduction

The Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard is an interactive business intelligence solution developed using SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Power BI for visualization.
It provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance across multiple store locations, product categories, and time periods. The dashboard enables stakeholders to track total sales, order volumes, and quantity sold, as well as identify top-performing locations and products.

This project demonstrates the integration of SQL-based data processing with advanced Power BI visualizations to deliver actionable business insights.

## Problem Statement

Coffee shop chains often collect large volumes of transactional data, but without proper analysis and visualization, it becomes challenging to:

* Monitor real-time sales trends across locations.
* Identify which products and categories generate the most revenue.
* Analyze peak sales hours and high-demand days.
* Compare weekday versus weekend performance.
* Optimize inventory and staffing based on demand patterns.

The objective of this project is to create a centralized dashboard that transforms raw transactional data into meaningful insights for data-driven decision-making.

If you’d like, I can also prepare a **shorter, more portfolio-friendly version** of this README that focuses on skills and tools, making it attractive for recruiters.
Do you want me to prepare that version next?
